   - https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7829183/comp1110-ass2/-/blob/main/src/comp1110/ass2/RaceToTheRaft.java?ref_type=heads#L450-472
   - 1.The code neatly organizes the game initialization into discrete steps, which improves readability and maintainability.
   - By separating the handling of different game elements (fire tiles, cat cards, raft cards, and board layout),
   - the function allows for easier updates and modifications to each component without affecting others.
   - 2.The method leverages object-oriented principles effectively by utilizing separate classes
   - (Cat, FireTile, RaftCard, Board, Island) to handle specific parts of the game setup.
   - This encapsulation of functionality into distinct objects adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle,
   - making the system easier to understand and manage.
